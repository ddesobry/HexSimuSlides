	abstract = {Mapping a triangulated surface to 2D space (or a tetrahedral mesh to 3D space) is an important problem in geometry processing. In computational physics, untangling plays an important role in mesh generation: it takes a mesh as an input, and moves the vertices to get rid of foldovers. In fact, mesh untangling can be considered as a special case of mapping where the geometry of the object is to be defined in the map space and the geometric domain is not explicit, supposing that each element is regular. In this paper, we propose a mapping method inspired by the untangling problem and compare its performance to the state of the art. The main advantage of our method is that the untangling aims at producing locally injective maps, which is the major challenge of mapping. In practice, our method produces locally injective maps in very difficult settings, both in 2D and 3D. We demonstrate it on a large reference database as well as on more difficult stress tests. For a better reproducibility, we publish the code in Python for a basic evaluation, and in C++ for more advanced applications.},

	abstract = {The Earth below ground is the subject of interest for many geophysical as well as geological investigations. Even though most practitioners would agree that all available information should be used in such an investigation, it is common practice that only a part of geological and geophysical information is actually integrated in structural geological models. We believe that some reasons for this omission are (a) an incomplete picture of available geological modeling methods, and (b) the problem of the perceived static picture of an inflexible geological representation in an image or geological model. With this work, we aim to contribute to the problem of subsurface interface detection through (a) the review of state-of-the-art geological modeling methods that allow the consideration of multiple aspects of geological realism in the form of observations, information, and knowledge, cast in geometric representations of subsurface structures, and (b) concepts and methods to analyze, quantify, and communicate related uncertainties in these models. We introduce a formulation for geological model representation and interpolation and uncertainty analysis methods with the aim to clarify similarities and differences in the diverse set of approaches that developed in recent years. We hope that this chapter provides an entry point to recent developments in geological modeling methods, helps researchers in the field to better consider uncertainties, and supports the integration of geological observations and knowledge in geophysical interpretation, modeling and inverse approaches.},

However, the qualification of a model as structurally complex is often qualitative and subjective making the comparison of the capabilities and performances of various geomodeling methods or software difficult. In this paper, we consider the notion of structural complexity from a geometrical point of view and argue that it can be characterized using general metrics computed on three-dimensional sealed structural models. We propose global and local measures of the connectivity and of the geometry of the model components and show how they permit to classify nine 3D synthetic structural models. Depending on the complexity elements favored, the classification varies. The models we introduce could be used as benchmark models for geomodeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {We introduce the idea of strict minimizers for geometric distortion measures used in shape interpolation, deformation, parametrization, and other applications involving geometric mappings. The L∞-norm ensures the tightest possible control on the worst-case distortion. Unfortunately, it does not yield a unique solution and does not distinguish between solutions with high or low distortion below the maximum. The strict minimizer is a minimal L∞-norm solution, which always prioritizes higher distortion reduction. We propose practical algorithms for computing strict minimizers. We also offer an efficient algorithm for L∞ optimization based on the ARAP energy. This algorithm can be used on its own or as a building block for an ARAP strict minimizer. We demonstrate that these algorithms lead to significant improvements in quality.},

It is based on a precise notion of discrete conformal equivalence for triangle meshes which mimics the notion of conformal equivalence for smooth surfaces. The problem of finding a flat mesh that is discretely conformally equivalent to a given mesh can be solved efficiently by minimizing a convex energy function, whose Hessian turns out to be the well known cot-Laplace operator. This method can also be used to map a surface mesh to a parameter domain which is flat except for isolated cone singularities, and we show how these can be placed automatically in order to reduce the distortion of the parameterization. We present the salient features of the theory and elaborate the algorithms with a number of examples.},

	abstract = {A conformal flattening maps a curved surface to the plane without distorting angles—such maps have become a fundamental building block for problems in geometry processing, numerical simulation, and computational design. Yet existing methods provide little direct control over the shape of the flattened domain, or else demand expensive nonlinear optimization. Boundary first flattening (BFF) is a linear method for conformal parameterization that is faster than traditional linear methods, yet provides control and quality comparable to sophisticated nonlinear schemes. The key insight is that the boundary data for many conformal mapping problems can be efficiently constructed via the Cherrier formula together with a pair of Poincaré-Steklov operators; once the boundary is known, the map can be easily extended over the rest of the domain. Since computation demands only a single factorization of the real Laplace matrix, the amortized cost is about 50× less than any previously published technique for boundary-controlled conformal flattening. As a result, BFF opens the door to real-time editing or fast optimization of high-resolution maps, with direct control over boundary length or angle. We show how this method can be used to construct maps with sharp corners, cone singularities, minimal area distortion, and uniformization over the unit disk; we also demonstrate for the first time how a surface can be conformally flattened directly onto any given target shape.},

	abstract = {The generation of quad meshes based on surface parametrization techniques has proven to be a versatile approach. These techniques quantize an initial seamless parametrization so as to obtain an integer grid map implying a pure quad mesh. State-of-the-art methods following this approach have to assume that the surface to be meshed either has no boundary, or has a boundary which the resulting mesh is supposed to be aligned to. In a variety of applications this is not desirable and non-boundary-aligned meshes or grid-parametrizations are preferred. We thus present a technique to robustly generate integer grid maps which are either boundary-aligned, non-boundary-aligned, or partially boundary-aligned, just as required by different applications. We thereby generalize previous work to this broader setting. This enables the reliable generation of trimmed quad meshes with partial elements along the boundary, preferable in various scenarios, from tiled texturing over design and modeling to fabrication and architecture, due to fewer constraints and hence higher overall mesh quality and other benefits in terms of aesthetics and flexibility.},

The singularities of the parametrization in general agree with singularities of the field, except in a small number of cases when several additional cones need to be added in a controlled way. Parametric lines can be constrained to follow an arbitrary set of feature lines on the surface. Our method is based on constructing an initial quad patch partition using robust cross-field integral line tracing. This process is followed by an algorithm modifying the quad layout structure to ensure that consistent parametric lengths can be assigned to the edges. For most meshes, the layout modification algorithm does not add new singularities; a small number of singularities may be added to resolve an explicitly described set of layouts. We demonstrate that our algorithm succeeds on a test data set of over a hundred meshes.},

	abstract = {We present a novel technique, both flexible and efficient, for interactive remeshing of irregular geometry. First, the original (arbitrary genus) mesh is substituted by a series of 2D maps in parameter space. Using these maps, our algorithm is then able to take advantage of established signal processing and halftoning tools that offer real-time interaction and intricate control. The user can easily combine these maps to create a control map — a map which controls the sampling density over the surface patch. This map is then sampled at interactive rates allowing the user to easily design a tailored resampling. Once this sampling is complete, a Delaunay triangulation and fast optimization are performed to perfect the final mesh.As a result, our remeshing technique is extremely versatile and general, being able to produce arbitrarily complex meshes with a variety of properties including: uniformity, regularity, semi-regularity, curvature sensitive resampling, and feature preservation. We provide a high level of control over the sampling distribution allowing the user to interactively custom design the mesh based on their requirements thereby increasing their productivity in creating a wide variety of meshes.},

	abstract = {Tangent vector fields are an essential ingredient in controlling surface appearance for applications ranging from anisotropic shading to texture synthesis and non-photorealistic rendering. To achieve a desired effect one is typically interested in smoothly varying fields that satisfy a sparse set of user-provided constraints. Using tools from Discrete Exterior Calculus, we present a simple and efficient algorithm for designing such fields over arbitrary triangle meshes. By representing the field as scalars over mesh edges (i.e., discrete 1-forms), we obtain an intrinsic, coordinate-free formulation in which field smoothness is enforced through discrete Laplace operators. Unlike previous methods, such a formulation leads to a linear system whose sparsity permits efficient pre-factorization. Constraints are incorporated through weighted least squares and can be updated rapidly enough to enable interactive design, as we demonstrate in the context of anisotropic texture synthesis.},

Inspired by the use of cross field in quad meshing and the CubeCover approach in hex meshing, we present a complete all-hex meshing framework based on singularity-restricted field that is essential to induce a valid all-hex structure. Given a volume represented by a tetrahedral mesh, we first compute a boundary-aligned 3D frame field inside it, then convert the frame field to be singularity-restricted by our effective topological operations. In our all-hex meshing framework, we apply the CubeCover method to achieve the volume parametrization. For reducing degenerate elements appearing in the volume parametrization, we also propose novel tetrahedral split operations to preprocess singularity-restricted frame fields. Experimental results show that our algorithm generates high-quality all-hex meshes from a variety of 3D volumes robustly and efficiently.},
